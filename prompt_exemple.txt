# Prompt Example â€“ Lyra Botanical Protocol (for LLM use)

This prompt is based on a real ecological context and should be used in conjunction with clear photos:
- 1 overview photo showing both plants in their environment
- 1 macro of each flower
- 1 photo with size reference (e.g., ruler or familiar object)

Two flowering plants were observed on April 8th in a low-altitude Mediterranean calcareous prairie (~200 m elevation), on dry soil, in an open environment.

Plant 1:
- Height: ~20 cm
- Flowers: yellow, solitary
- Foliage: narrow, elongated
- Habit: erect

Plant 2:
- Height: ~20 cm
- Flowers: purple, monocotyledon
- Foliage: sword-like (gladiolate)
- Habit: erect

Please provide a list of the most likely species for each plant, in decreasing order of probability, up to a cumulative 95% likelihood.

Then, assuming these two species are *Narcissus assoanus* and *Iris lutescens*, list the most probable third co-occurring flowering species in the same biotope, between early April and mid-May, also up to a cumulative 95% total probability.
